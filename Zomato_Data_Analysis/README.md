# Zomato Customer Behavior and Trend Analysis üêçüìä

Welcome to my Zomato Data Analysis project! This project leverages Python‚Äôs powerful data analysis libraries to explore and extract insights from the Zomato restaurant dataset. Through this project, I have uncovered customer preferences, online vs. offline ordering trends, pricing strategies, and more. The analysis aims to answer key questions about restaurant types, price ranges, and order preferences based on real data.

## Project Overview
In this project, I analyzed the Zomato restaurant dataset to gain insights into restaurant preferences, customer behavior, and ratings. By utilizing Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I performed in-depth analysis and visualized trends that answer important questions about the restaurant industry.

The main goal of the project was to identify patterns and trends in the following areas:

+ Online vs. offline order preferences
+ Most popular restaurant types
+ Price ranges for couples
+ Restaurant ratings

## Technologies Used

* Python: Core programming language for analysis.
* NumPy: For efficient numerical computations.
* Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
* Matplotlib: For creating static visualizations like bar charts, histograms, etc.
* Seaborn: For creating advanced statistical graphics like 
* heatmaps and scatter plots.

## Key Questions Addressed

1. Do more restaurants provide online delivery compared to offline services?
2. Which types of restaurants are the most favored by the general public?
3. What price range is preferred by couples for their dinner at restaurants?

## Findings and Insights

Through my analysis, I was able to extract the following key insights:

1. Online vs Offline Orders:

+ A greater number of restaurants provide offline services, specifically dining establishments.
+ Cafes tend to accept online orders more frequently compared to other restaurant types.

2. Popular Restaurant Types:

+ Dining restaurants are the most preferred by customers for in-person visits.

3. Price Preferences:

+ Couples prefer restaurants with an approximate cost of 300 INR for dinner.

4. Restaurant Ratings:

* The majority of restaurants received ratings between 3.5 and 4 stars.
* Online orders generally receive better ratings than offline orders.

## Conclusion
+ Dining restaurants primarily cater to offline orders, while cafes cater to online orders.
+ Customers prefer the convenience of online ordering at cafes but enjoy dining in at traditional restaurants.
+ These insights can help restaurants understand customer preferences and tailor their services to meet demand.

## Visualizations
