Build an online car rental platform using Object-Oriented Programming in Python:

A car rental company has requested you to build an online car rental platform where customers should be able to view the available cars that can be rented on an hourly, daily, or weekly basis. The company can display the available inventory and confirm requests by checking the available stock. Customers will receive an auto-generated bill when they return the car.
